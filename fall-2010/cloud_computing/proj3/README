HOWTO
First, you need to go to my directory for this project on nimbus17, which is /home/w234sxg/project3
Test this project by running the following command in PWD. 
./run.sh
and ./run-local.sh will run the pig script locally. 

NOTICE: 
After deleting the output directories, you will be led into the pig Grunt command line, 
within the command line, you can run the program by typing "run proj3.pig". 

Concerning the layout of the files and directories, I recommend to change
to my user name w234sxg with passwd w234sxg
