FUNCTION DESCRIPTION

- According to the project requirement, I have implemented the following 
  functions for this project. 
  -- manually insert an Employee record by providing all employee info; 
  -- search the database with last name as keyword; 
  -- save the employee records to a file, which can be read in again; 
  -- load employee records from file; 
  -- print all the employee records to stdout (additional); 
  -- print the total number of records of the employee list (additional);
  -- quit.
NOTE: In order to deal with cases when user entered last name as totally lower
      case letters, which can potentially bring some trouble to the ordering step,
      so I simply changed the first lower letter to upper case letter. 

DOCUMENTATION

- run "make doc" to make class reference(API) html files.

Please note that, in order to generate API doc with the "make doc"
command, your system needs to have doxygen and dot installed. 

Due to the size of the doc files, I didn't attach them with this project sub-
mission, if you met any problems during the processing of generating docs, 
please reference related documents or contact me through: gsmsteve@gmail.com.
