README file for Programming Assignment 1
========================================

Your directory should now contain the following files:

 Makefile -> [cool dir]/assignments/PA1/Makefile
 README
 type.cl
 type.test -> [cool dir]/assignments/PA1/type.test
 type_eg.s -> [cool dir]/assignments/PA1/type_eg.s

	The Makefile contains targets for compiling and running your
	program, as well as handing it in.

	The README contains this info. Part of the assignment is to
	answer the questions at the end of this README file.
	Just edit this file.

	type.cl is the skeleton file which you should fill in with
	your program.

	type.test is a short test input. It is run through your program 
        when you hand it in, and the output is also handed in.

        type_eg.s contains the assembly code for a correct solution to 
        the assignment. You can execute it using CSPIM to verify how the 
        program should run for a given set of inputs.


Instructions
------------

	To compile and run your program, type:

	% /usr/local/bin/make test

        To turnin your work, type the following from the directory containing 
        the assignment files:

        % /usr/local/bin/make turnin

        This will collect the files type.cl and README. Do not forget
        to edit the README file and to answer the questions.

        You may turn in the assignment as many times as you like.  However,
        only the last version will be retained for grading.

	GOOD LUCK!
