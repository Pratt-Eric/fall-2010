SortedList.h - A base class for sorted list with pure virtual functions; 
LinkedSortedList.cpp - Implementation of Linked Sorted List; 
main.cpp - A test program to test the implementation of LinkedSortedList. 

How to Test: 
- Type make command in the CWD; 
- Run ./proj1 to run the test program; 
- According to the project requirement, I have implemented the int and
  double LinkedSortedList, and created two arrays for both int and
  double data types. Below are the steps that I did the test. 
  -- Insert each element within the array to the sorted list; 
  -- Print the list using the print() method; 
  -- Test the find() method for each element; 
  -- print the list using the getfirst() method; 
  -- clear the list and insert again and print using print() method; 

- run "make doc" to make class reference html files.
Please note that, in order to generate doc with the "make doc"
command, you system needs to have doxygen and dot installed.
