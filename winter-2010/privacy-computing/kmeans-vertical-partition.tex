\section*{Problem Description}

K-means clustering over vertically partitioned data among multiple
parties brings challenges for privacy protection. This paper proposes
a privacy protection protocol under this scenario. 

\section*{Contribution of this paper}
This paper proposes a privacy protection method by disguising the site
component(attribute values) with random values, and using permuted
distance comparison result for purpose of communication among
different parties.  

By utilizing secure circuit evaluation method, distance comparison
result is calculated without disclosing anything else. 

And in the proposed protocol, three parties are explicitely selected as
special parties, one party $P_1$ is responsible for generating perturbation
and permutation matrix, another party $P_2$ is used for final distance
comparison with the third party $P_r$ which is responsible for
computing the distance of all parties except $P_2$ and do distance
comparison with $P_2$. By doing this, all the parties will not be able
to have all the information about another party so that privacy can be
protected.

\section*{Weaknesses of this paper}
No experimental results are given by this paper. 

The K-means clustering accuracy is not discussed.
