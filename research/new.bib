    abstract = {Networks of coupled dynamical systems have been used to model biological oscillators1, 2, 3, 4, Josephson junction arrays5,6, excitable media7, neural networks8, 9, 10, spatial games11, genetic control networks12 and many other self-organizing systems. Ordinarily, the connection topology is assumed to be either completely regular or completely random. But many biological, technological and social networks lie somewhere between these two extremes. Here we explore simple models of networks that can be tuned through this middle ground: regular networks 'rewired' to introduce increasing amounts of disorder. We find that these systems can be highly clustered, like regular lattices, yet have small characteristic path lengths, like random graphs. We call them 'small-world' networks, by analogy with the small-world phenomenon13,14 (popularly known as six degrees of separation15). The neural network of the worm Caenorhabditis elegans, the power grid of the western United States, and the collaboration graph of film actors are shown to be small-world networks. Models of dynamical systems with small-world coupling display enhanced signal-propagation speed, computational power, and synchronizability. In particular, infectious diseases spread more easily in small-world networks than in regular lattices.},

E-mail and news articles are two natural examples of such streams, each characterized by topics that appear, grow in intensity for a period of time, and then fade away. The published literature in a particular research field can be seen to exhibit similar phenomena over a much longer time scale. Underlying much of the text mining work in this area is the following intuitive premise --- that the appearance of a topic in a document stream is signaled by a &quot;burst of activity,&quot; with certain features rising sharply in frequency as the topic emerges.},

Abstract = {In this paper, we study a novel problem of staring people dis- 
covery from social networks, which is concerned with finding 
people who are not only authoritative but also sociable in the 
social network. We formalize this problem as an optimiza- 
tion programming problem. Taking the co-author network 
as a case study, we define three objective functions and pro- 
pose two methods to combine these objective functions. A 
genetic algorithm based method is further presented to solve 
this problem. Experimental results show that the proposed 
solution can effectively find the staring people from social 
networks.},

@article{research_issue_sn,
Abstract = {Social Computing and online communities have ushered in a new era of the web, where information and communication technologies are facilitating organized human endeavor in fundamentally new ways. The broad impact of social computing in diverse domains and the complexity of features that span diverse disciplines pose new challenges for Information Systems researchers. Information Systems research should expand its scope and adapt theories and methodologies from even more disciplines to address this challenge. This phenomenon has diverse theoretical connections and bridges social and technical aspects. Thus it offers an ideal opportunity for IS researchers to take the lead in demonstrating the focus of IS in cross-disciplinary research and emphasizing praxis. We outline salient traits of social computing as a precursor to discussing research challenges. Research issues related to organization theory, property rights, motivational and social aspects, and network dynamics are discussed. W},
