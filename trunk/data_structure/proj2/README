SortedList.h - A base class for sorted list with pure virtual functions; 
LinkedSortedList.cpp - Implementation of Linked Sorted List; 
SortedVector.h - A vector version of the employee database with b-search; 
SortedVector.cpp - Implementation of the SortedVector class; 
main.cpp - A test program to test the implementation of LinkedSortedList. 
main.vector.cpp - A test program to test the vector version.

How to Test: 
- Type make command in the CWD; 
- Run ./proj1 to run the test program; 
- Run ./proj1.vector to run the program of vector version. 
- According to the project requirement, I have implemented the following 
  functions for this project. 
  -- manually insert an Employee record by providing all employee info; 
  -- search the database with last name as keyword; 
  -- save the employee records to a file, which can be read in again; 
  -- load employee records from file; 
  -- print all the employee records to stdout (additional); 
  -- print the total number of records of the employee list (additional);
  -- quit.

- run "make doc" to make class reference(API) html files.
Please note that, in order to generate doc with the "make doc"
command, you system needs to have doxygen and dot installed. 
In this project submission, I have included the document files for your 
reference, and you can see the doc files by going to the html folder
and open index.html file using your webbrowser(Firefox/chrome?). 

You can check out the project code base from the google code by: 
svn co http://project-2010-fall.googlecode.com/svn/trunk proj1

Note that this is only a ready only version, so you can make changes
but can't commit any of your changes to the code base. If you really
want to commit, let me know!
